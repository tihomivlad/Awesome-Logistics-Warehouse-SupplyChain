# Awesome Supply Chain [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

A curated list of supply chain, logistics, and warehouse management resources for professionals in the field.

Well-known and industry-standard resources are included as a baseline reference. The emphasis of this list, however, is on uncovering under-the-radar tools, niche solutions, and practical knowledge that may otherwise be overlooked.

**Contributions are especially encouraged for lesser-known, high-quality tools, open resources, and practitioner-tested solutions that are not already widely publicized.**
